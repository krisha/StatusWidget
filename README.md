backspace door widget for android
==============

This is a widget for android to show the count of members currently in the hackerspace.

If the space is opened it will vibrate shortly and push a notification. When the space closes the notification will be removed. The state is automatically updated every few minutes but can be forced by clicking on the widget.

The current state is read from the status API through HTTP.

There are no options and no GUI to change any settings. Just minimalistic and simple!

If you don't like the vibration, change your phone to one with a more smart vibration (or change the code) ;)
